## 🌟 Why Feature-First Development?

Feature-first development is an approach that focuses on building software features incrementally, with each feature encapsulated within its own module or component. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by keeping related code together and separating concerns effectively.

By following a feature-first approach, developers can easily add, update, or remove features without causing unintended side effects on other parts of the codebase. It also makes it easier to test individual features independently, leading to more robust and reliable applications.
